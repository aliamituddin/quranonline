 'text_Learn_Qirat_Online'=>'Learn ten Qirat online  with us   with best teachers online from Egypt. Quran Ayat Institute facilitate interested students with this opportunity. Lets have a short introduction to these ten Qirat. In Quran, Qira’at, literally means the readings, and terminologically means the method of recitation of the Holy Quran. Traditionally, there are 10 recognized schools of Qira’at, and each one derives its name from the famous reader of the Holy Quran recitation. It is necessary to understand what are the 10 Qirat before you join to learn ten Qirat online. What are the Ten Qirats? Ten Qirats are not like different voices and different styles, rather these are slight differences in pronunciation, letters and Harakat. It is like comparing two different books of Quran and you find differences between them. To know this clearly, we need to go back to the times of Prophet (PBUH) and Islamic history. People in the times of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) were illiterate, and they have their own dialect of their own tribe like any other language. Like in case of English of British and American. It has differences of spelling and pronunciation. Same was the case for that time that they have different like dialect of Quraish which was the tribe of Holy Prophet (PBUH), dialect of Yaman, dialect of Hudair and many more. These dialects have slight differences but without change in the meaning. Within the Qira’at, there are two categories: Mutawatir: The transmission which has independent chains of authorities so wide as to rule out the possibility of any error and on which there is consensus of Ulema of that time. Mashhur: these are slightly less wide in their transmission, but still so wide as to make error highly unlikely to happen. There are 7 Mutawatir Qira’at: 1) Nafi’ (d. 169/785) 2) Ibn Kathir (d. 120/737) 3) Abu ‘Amr ibn al-‘Ala’ (d. 154/762) 4) Ibn ‘Amir (d. 154/762) 5) ‘Asim (d. 127/744) 6) Hamza (d. 156/772) 7) al-Kisa’i (d. 189/904) There are 3 Mashhur: 1) Abu Ja’far (d. 130/747) 2) Ya’qub (d. 205/820) 3) Khalaf (d. 229/843) ',

'Learn_Quranic_Arabic'=>'Learn Quranic Arabic',
'text_Learn_Quranic_Arabic'=>'Learn Quranic Arabic  with us  Institute. If you’re truly dedicated to fully understanding all of the teachings within the Quran, then you’ll absolutely need to learn Quranic Arabic to do so. While this religious text has been translated into other languages—including English—you lose out on some of the intricacies of the meanings if you don’t read it in the source language. This is one of the most important reasons to learn the Arabic language to understand the Quran. So, what exactly is the best way to learn this special form of Arabic? You may be a little overwhelmed at the prospect of learning an entire new language just to read the Quran, but it’s easier than you think. Follow these tips to improve your overall learning experience and success: Learn the Tajweed – In order to prevent mispronunciation of words and terminology in the Quran, readers of the book must follow certain recitation rules called tajweed. These recitation rules were created to replicate the way the prophet Mohammed recited the Quran. Start learning the tajweed early on so you can apply them to your own recitations. This can also help you understand recitations from other people to better improve your chances of success in learning the language. Study Basic Grammar – As you start learning Quranic Arabic, the most important thing is to study first is basic grammar. While it’s true that it might take years for you to learn and memorize the entirety of Quranic Arabic’s grammar, you can get a good initial grasp within the first few hours of study. When you focus on learning basic grammar first, you can piece together full sentences and start understanding their meaning earlier. Study Arabic to English (or your native language) – Since you are learning Quranic Arabic to read the Quran, it’s most important that you focus your energy on learning how to translate Arabic to English, or your native language, and not the other way around. Since you’re not trying to learn conversational Arabic, you don’t need to spend any time or effort trying to learn how to ask for directions or order food, saving yourself more time in the long run. As such, only focus on learning the principles behind translating Arabic to your native language. Study Quran-specific Terminology – As with most religions, the Quran contains many religion-specific terminology and vocabulary that you don’t experience much in day-to-day life. As such, it’s important that you spend your time and effort into learning Quran-specific terminology. It’s also true that much of the vocabulary in the Quran is repeated often throughout the text. In fact, did you know that only 300 words make up over 70% of the entire book? If you learn those 300 words early, you’ll be able to read the Quran quite simply.',

It means to pronounce every letter correctly with all its qualities. The rules themselves can be studied independently, but their correct application can only be done by listening to, reciting to, and being corrected by, a qualified teacher of the Qur’an. Unfortunately, many do not know proper tajweed. In the days of the Prophet, peace and blessing upon him, there was no need for the study of tajweed because they talked with what is now known as tajweed; in other words, it was natural for them. Now, over 14 centuries later, colloquial Arabic has changed radically from the classical Arabic with which the Qur’an was revealed, and Arabs have to study tajweed, just in the same way that non-Arabs do.',

It exists most notably in the written form. Interest in Arabic has increased in recent years. Many people find the Arabic writing system especially fascinating. It is written from right to left.
